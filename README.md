# Phoney

A simple server with a few endpoints to mock some of the common async tasks related to a web app. Such as;

1. user authentication
2. basic CRUD operations

_________

This will also be used to store and send sample data from third party APIs so as to avoid excessive calls to the real endpoint and thereby exhausting one's call limit during development.

## Installation
